# Technical Approach: Social Media Content Analyzer

I built a two-tier solution that keeps the React interface responsive while delegating heavy parsing work to an Express API. The frontend focuses on clarity and accessibility: drag-and-drop uploads, explicit loading states, and modular components that surface the most relevant metrics (word count, sentiment, hashtags, CTAs, engagement score) alongside tailored suggestions. Files post to the backend via `FormData`, keeping the browser free from large parsing bundles and enabling consistent results regardless of device.

On the server, Multer streams uploads into isolated temporary paths with validation and size caps. PDFs flow through `pdf-parse`, while images invoke a Tesseract worker that loads the bundled English `eng.traineddata` locally, avoiding brittle CDN fetches. Extracted text passes through normalization, stop-word filtering, sentiment heuristics, and scoring logic tuned for social media content. The worker lifecycle guarantees resources release after each job.

Cross-cutting concerns include CORS configuration, structured error handling that returns user-friendly messages, and cleanup of temporary files. The codebase remains extensible: adding languages, richer NLP, or persistent storage would only touch well-scoped modules. Overall the implementation meets the assessment brief within the time budget while leaving a maintainable foundation for future growth.
